# Spinning Handle in Space
This project is an attempt at simulating a rotating body using Euler angles.

The goal of this projext is to observe the "tennis racket effekt" by simulating a spinning handle in zero gravity 
using 3D rigid body dynamics.

This will be done from scratch using the c programming language that i started learning recently. 

Probably also worth noting that this was made with GCC compiler on Windows 11 with WSL 2.

## Theory
 * Euler angles
 * Inertia & momenta
 * Euler kinematics
 * RK4 discretization

## Implementation
Will document what is contained in the different files

## Result
A little summaty plus some gifs of my simulations working hopefully.
