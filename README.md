# spinning-handle
An attempt at simulating a rotating body using Euler angles.

The goal of this projext is to observe the "tennis racket effekt" by simulating a spinning handle in zero gravity 
using 3D rigid body dynamics.

This will be done from scratch using the c programming language that i started learning recently.
